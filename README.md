A simple calculator application with PySimpleGUI interface.

For linux debian (xubuntu tested) users there is a fully functional version in file "calc app", which is enough to download and run.

For others:

- launch via command line "python calc.py" in the project folder
- optional, you can make executable file for different OS, if use "pyinstaller" (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

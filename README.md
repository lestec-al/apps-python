# Simple Calculator
A simple calculator application with PySimpleGUI interface.

For linux debian (xubuntu tested) users there is a fully functional version in file "calc app", which is enough to download and run.

For others:
- install Python (version 3.9 or higher)
- install PySimpleGUI (https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-pysimplegui)
- download this project and extract zip
- launch via command line "python calc.py" in the project folder

Also in file "calc_s.py" is a version of the calculator without PySimpleGUI, which works through the terminal.
